This repo is associated with the paper [Topological Schr√∂dinger Bridge Matching](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WzCEiBILHu&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DICLR.cc%2F2025%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions)), accepted by __ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)__. 

It includes two main parts:

1. [Tutorial](GTSB_ClosedForm/readme.md) on implementing the closed-form topological SB solutions, i.e., Thms 6 & 7 in the paper. 
2. [Experimental results](TSBLearning/readme.md) on various datasets including earthquake data, ocean flows, brain signals and single-cell data.
